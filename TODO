TODO: Is there a way we can set the size of `stdout` before exiting?
TODO: I dunno what `sealing` is, but maybe that can be used? Or, if not, a specific `fcntl()` call? Finding this out will allow consumers of `collect`'s output to use a single `splice()` instead of many, greatly improving its performance in pipelines as its output can be used like an actual file's...
